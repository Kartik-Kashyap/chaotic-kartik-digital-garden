# **WELCOME TO THE CHAOTIC GARDEN** 🌪️ 


> [!attention] 
> This garden is currently being developed so things may not be the best or even a thing at all. You are free to explore but don't expect much. But ideally this garden will soon be alive and growing, mutating, and sometimes, even burning to the ground before sprouting again. You'll still be free to wander, but again you wouldn't have to expect polished paths—expect **chaos, raw thoughts, and unfinished roads**.

   
> _“Some thoughts bloom, some wither, and some take root where you least expect.”_

   
>[!summary]- Who And Why Am I?
> For who part, I'll leave it for you to decide and form your own meta-perception of mine.
> For why part, here's the answer:
> - sitting back, letting all play, observing, defamiliarizing and trying to make sense of our chaotic human existence
> - mostly my khyaal (thoughts/observations) and khoj (findings/research) 
> - 6K questions = kya (what), kyun (why), kaun (who), kab (when), kahan (where), kaise (how)
> - kARTistik side = kahani, kavita, kala, kalam, karuna 

   
> _“So many questions, so little time.”_
