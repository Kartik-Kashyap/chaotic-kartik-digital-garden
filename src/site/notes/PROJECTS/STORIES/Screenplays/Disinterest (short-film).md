Title: DISINTEREST
Credit: A 1-Minute Short-Film
Author: Written by Kartik Kashyap
Draft date: 2/2/2024

(the screenplay is in fountain format)

___

Dreamy MONTAGE:
*(Of dreams about tension about interests, careers, and future. And echo of "ye sb krne se ghar nhi chlega")*
- whole short film chaotic recap with fast cuts
- backspacing or deleting the poem draft out of frustration, with "ye sab krne se ghar nhi chlta" voice echoing in cacophonic way
- yelling loudly at an abandoned place, releasing all his frustration
- punching on the wall
- use 1/8 shutter speed for dreamy feel


INT. AAKASH ROOM - MORNING

*(Lot of jump cuts here:)*
Alarm rings. Aakash wakes up from the horrifying dream. He uncovers himself from the blanket. Gets his spine erect. *(camera following his movement)*.
Coping with the aftermath of stressful thoughts & dream hangovers, he made some weird faces *(just like the frame of end of film)*.
Then turns his laptop on, placed on the table, from sleep mode. Sees the vs code screen with an error printed in the terminal. Disappointed, with one hand supporting his head, he minimized it. To no escape from disappointment, he finds an AOT anime drawing on the next window that he tried to draw last day. He sees his amateuish drawing he made of that and compared the two. Becoming even more cringed thus disinterested, he closes the laptop & the drawing book, drops his leg from the bed, faces the camera straight, and yawns...

[Alt: He cringed and thus became disinterested. Then he put both his hands on his face with lower part of palm on his eyes and rubbed against it, depicting him feeling lost & lil agitated]

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. HOSTEL MESS - MORNING

(CONT'D) Him yawning in mess with both his hands folded and kept on the eating table, and plate with food in front-

[Alt: (CONT'D) Him rubbing against the eyes, not focusing on the food in his front]

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. KARTIK'S ROOM - MORNING (10 a.m.)

(CONT'D) Him still yawning, wearing his bag on his shoulder, ready to go to college.
 
[Alt: Him still rubbing his face, but this time the reason is to rub the cream he just applied or to soak the water off his face after he did face wash - to look atleast a bit fresh, as he hasn't taken bath since eternity, and his disinterest in life evident in his baggy eyes doesn't help either]

His wingies - HARSH, PALASH, PRINSU - all ready to go to school too, evident with them having bags on their shoulder and they being on the edges of bed, ready to leave - discussing something in the background, that's gibberish to his ears and doesn't interest him at all, but they seem like having the fun of their life *(it shows the contrast)*.

PALASH
(Pointing to aakash)
Aekkarr attendance ta itna kam hayi ki teacher dekh ke kahtan, tum aaye kahe ha college ma, ghar ae pe rahtis

All of them bursts into laughter.

Unaffected, Aakash checks the timetable sticked on the wall (classes from 10-5 written there), then checks his wrist watch, it shows 10 am. He, not so hurriedly since he's emotionally numb and disinterested for college anyways, picks up his water bottle.

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. NEAR WATER COOLER - MORNING

Placing the bottle below the tap to fill water, but finding it difficult to not spill it, given the small areas/space of water cooler, which formed a collection of droplets on the side of his wrist. It looks oddly satisfying *(close-up cinematic shot of droplets)*.
Aakash observes his hands and gets to see its fascinating poetic aspect. 
Meanwhile Harsh got down the stair with his bag hurriedly yelling "bhag bhag bhag... late ho gya" 
*(detailing - showing that Aakash got emersed in this thing depicting that he has found his new interest, thus forgetting that he had less attendance)*
He gets excited about the idea. Gets his phone out & starts typing the poem title WELLING *(or SHAPE OF DROPLETS)*. He keeps typing the initial draft when walking only.

MATCH CUT TO:

(CONT'D) Him typing in different settings like road/cycle, class, lunch mess, again class then...

[Alt: (A lot of JUMP CUTS here:) Camera panning to his smiling and enthusiastic face showing variety of emotions - of thinking, getting good idea, then realising its not that good, getting actually good idea, finding it difficult to think how to end the poem, then finally completing the first draft that he's kinda proud of - with him walking from water cooler to the end or start stair of the 1st floor floor - almost like a stop motion video, or 1/8 shutter speed video]

JUMP CUT TO:

INT. 1st FLOOR STAIRS - EVENING (5 p.m.)

Aakash sitting on the start or end stair of 1st floor. 
*(Close-Up)*
Almost completed the poem. He is happy, visible from the wide grin he has on his face and legs near his hips, sitting almost in a squatting position since he can't control his excitement induced from his new creation.
He begins daydreaming about becoming a big poet with crowd cheering for him *(with camera panning on his face - background sound of crowd starts getting loud in his head but...)*
Suddenly, HARSH comes out of nowhere from behind, breaking his daydream, and took his phone from his hand forcefully.

HARSH
Kochi kr rha h ree?!

Aakash checks his watch, it shows 5 p.m.
He's shocked but satisfied that so much time has passed already without him even realising (depicting that he really had joy & was interested in writing this poetry)

Camera reveals the poetry he wrote while Harsh is trying to understand what & why is written, but only from a critics pov, not to praise it's artistic side.

HARSH
(In a mocking way)
Arre kya tum daily nya shauk sab paal leta hai - iske liye tum class bhi nhi aaya?... 

Harsh gives his phone back and started walking away from Aakash to his room.

HARSH
Brbaad hai tum bhai... kuch productive krlo, mauka h... ye sab krne se ghar nhi chalega *(shinchan meme reference) 
(his dialogue sound fading as gets farther away)
(Show Aakash face only, during this dialogue, same as below depiction)

Aakash feels shattered. Harsh's last line echoed in his mind. His face down to his toes. But deep down he also comes to agree with it after the quick emotional turmoil inside his head. Now ready to prove everyone that he can do something productive, he feels motivated to restart coding (evident from his heavy breathing and tightening fist). He lifts his head...

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. AAKASH ROOM - LATE NIGHT

...He lifts his head looking at the screen of his laptop. It's a dark room, with only the table lamp as the source of light.
Aakash is trying to execute the simple hello world code in c language. But gcc error / fatal error. 
Camera shows his diary where he'd wrote the coding restart plan. He flips 1 page back, where one old coding plan is crossed with red pen and all the other career option written on the other side - all crossed.
He seems disappointed and agitated, thus disinterested again since no tangible result thus lack of dopamine - resulting in him angrily crossing out the new coding plan too.

Then faces the camera and yawns.
Then pull his legs back on the bed, lie down his spine and wears the blanket simultaneously.
And goes to sleep.

[Alt: Camera pans on his face. His stressed and thus overthinking about a lot of thing with scenarios playing in his heads - that is actually the dream montage at start]

*(... Thus the loop continues)*
