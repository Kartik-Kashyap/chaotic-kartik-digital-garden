## STORY

Anand was only 14, but he felt older. His dead eyes reflected the world he had grown up in–the lively side of which was built upon the poor and oppressed. 
He ate his father’s slaps for just existing. Handled a narcissistic mom who got bullied by his father and in return lashed out at him. 

The outside world wasn’t much different. His neighborhood reeked of hopelessness—people scraping by, kids like him forgotten by society. All were desensitized to death. A fight that ended in blood, a corpse floating in the river after no one came to claim him at the mortuary, upper caste supremacists beating lower castes to death with no repercussions, the government destroying houses of the poor to build roads for the rich—the world seemed like one cruel joke, and Anand, by now, had stopped laughing. 

He knew he lost the birth lottery. He knew the world didn't care, not for him at all. He stopped caring too. He had no attachments. He had no home. He had no friends. He learned early that emotions were dangerous. Love was weakness, tears were ammunition for mockery, hope was a lie, purpose was an escape, and god was a sadist. He didn't have a past to reminisce or a future to imagine to escape the present. He only had a present, and nothing else to lose or desire. 

The first time he saw someone die with his naked eyes, a man knifed in a gang fight, all he felt was…nothing. A strange emptiness, like it didn’t matter. Rather death was the greatest relief, and making one achieve that was the greatest philanthropy.

At the government school he attended, he was a loner, bullied by both his teachers and classmates. No one made him feel at ease. He was a punching bag for them to lash out their bleakness in life. He was invisible, and in time, he started to believe he didn’t exist. The only thing that made him feel real was the growing darkness inside him—a cold, creeping thing that told him that in this world, power was the only truth. Machiavellians climbed the social hierarchy. Narcissists became celebs. Everyone hurt each other. It was the natural order. Why not be the one doing the hurting?

It started small. Hurting street animals in the alleys, just to see if he could feel something, anything. A cat’s strangled cries when he hit it with a rod, a dog's screams when he rode over its tail, a rat's shrieks when he made it a ball to play catch till its body was limp—it made his pulse quicken, but there was no remorse. Anand realized he could control life, and take it, and no one noticed. No one cared. Why should he?
It made him feel visible. His actions had meaning and impact on others. They wanted him to stop, their life depended on his mercy. He felt powerful. It made him ecstatic. Anand was in a peculiar state of Anand. He found his drug and was ready to overdose.

And he did.
He got recognition as a fierce sadistic hunter in the next year. He fought and tortured, till his sadism got curbed for the day. 
When his school teacher started beating him for drinking water from his pot, he struck back. Hit him with the brick, left unused during construction, with all that he had. Harder than that oldie could handle. Brain hemorrhage. On-the-spot death. The teachers were horrified, the students afraid, but to Anand, it was just confirmation of what he had always known: life was worthless. And death united us, we all being equal at it. 
There were no heroes, no justice, no morality–just legal dogmas. There was only survival, and in survival, being the predator was better than being the prey.

Psychiatrists would later say he lacked empathy, and that he was a textbook psychopath. But they didn’t know his world. They didn’t know what it was like to grow up in a place where love was nonexistent, where poetic romanticization of life was risible, where the value of life was cheaper than the food they couldn’t afford.

The system had failed him long before he became a headline. Anand was a product of everything wrong around him—poverty, violence, neglect, oppression, apathy and nihilism. The world had shown him its ugliness, and he had become a mirror for it. 

By the time they locked him away for the crime—the one that took a life—it was too late. He no longer saw the world the way others did. He never would. The boy was gone. All that was left was the monster it had created.
