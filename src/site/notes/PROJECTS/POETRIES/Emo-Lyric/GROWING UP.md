Reminiscing the past,

perplexed emotions triggered.

Memories died unlamented in vast,

some cherished, other flickered.

With people, stayed,

filled life's chapters, had fun, shined

—then lost them in envisaged ways.

Hope you all doing fine,

we may never cross again.

Heart's aching, soul's crying,

nature's sublimity is uncertain.

Sole existence itself is futile,

only "changes" makes it worthwhile.

"Forever"—a loop of lies,

it's true, as time flies.
