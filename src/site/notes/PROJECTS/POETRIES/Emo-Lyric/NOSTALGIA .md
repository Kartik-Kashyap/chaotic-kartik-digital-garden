Nostalgia - a nugatory feeling,

But an indication of how fulfilled our life has been.

Nostalgia - it's misleading.

It glorifies the past via fallacies.

Old & vivid memories gives warmth.

When lived, felt nothing.

Hilarity of how we appreciate the present,

When far from it.

Begrudging past self his frivolous state of being.

Plunging ourselves into abject misery,

Though currently much sober than ever been.

The incredible human's ability -

Vast memory & perpetual imagination -

We suffers the same, a matter of indignation.
