Ferocious clock hands moving tediously.
This warmth inducing blanket,
My daydreaming place.
Wish I could stay here for eternity.
But nothing is spared, no excuses works,
Have to face the outside world - vicious, dark & frigid.
Already suffered ineffable pain,
Now emotionally numb & tepid.
It's drizzling, by these cold droplets of angst, I'm hemmed.
I hate you, you left me behind to death freeze,
But I know you're feeling no different.
I guess we changed, that's how everything is.
I miss you, all our efforts & tries,
Every of our activities filled with gusto,
Passing in front of my eyes.
There hasn't been a day that I have forgotten you.
I hear a train passing by,
Getting farther away with time.
I know I have to catch one of them but I'm scared to hell.
The sound of horn fades away,
I don't know why I'm mulling it over.
This phase is so tough
But I'll figure something out, don't worry!
If I have more patience,
If I gather more resilience,
If I work a little more hard,
If I endure few more nights,
I'll go see you, I'll go pick you up.
I need your hug to melt the ice,
I wanna hold your hand and never let it go
As it's no one but you, my best friend.
This melancholic & taxing etude too shall end,
A frivolous & serene scherzo awaits.
Please bear this fleeting winter wind for a bit more,
Sunshine in winter comes for sure.
