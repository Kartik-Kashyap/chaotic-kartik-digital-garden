Approaching the end months of another futile year.

Switching phases strikes inside a bewildering fear.

Monsoon segues into autumn.

Leaves, yellower, estranged from their parents, lies on bottom.

Was suffering slow death since a long, all got a breathing room.

Time's so cruel, I'll be a grown-up soon.

Day is shorter, kinder is sunlight,

The ambience bittersweet, chilly is night.

Memories of every previous autumn gets interwined.

Excruciating yet comfort emanating feelings run through my spine.

The azure & serene sky, I'm missing something.

Slowly sun seeps through the sky, twilight breeze incoming.

This nugatory being has grown, though it's still 'me'.

Shaded lethal desires, at present it's free.

The ravage of time, decline of charm.

Hope upcoming winter will delve & radiate some warmth.
