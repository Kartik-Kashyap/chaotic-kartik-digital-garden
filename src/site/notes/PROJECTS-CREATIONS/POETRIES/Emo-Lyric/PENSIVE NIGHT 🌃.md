Open field & sky,

Sitting here, been an hour.

Don't wanna move,

As grass underneath got warmer.

It's getting darker & colder,

I'm only getting weaker & older.

The stars above me,

Are they judging?

'Cause I'm no wonder like them?

The vast universe,

It's intimidating.

How valuable is my presence?

Waning crescent moon, beyond my reach,

Why it's mourning?

'Cause it'll soon be a new one?

What if the next morning never comes?

Do I even have a yearn to live?

My mistakes, who'll forgive?

My goals, will they go kaput?

How much will I miss out?

Will I die unlamented?

Haha, it's a night of existential questioning, I guess.
