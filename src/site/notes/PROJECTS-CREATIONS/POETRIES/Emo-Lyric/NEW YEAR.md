Midnight, tired of staring at the ceiling fan.

Closed eyes, letting thoughts dominate.

One more year left the life span,

One more year nearer death bed.

Heard firecrackers, pretentious celebration of today,

Concealing inner storms ever helped?

Not being edgy or facing existential angst,

Neither any disaster, natural or man-made.

Just adrift and isolated

In this grandiose ocean,

Where tiniest motion brings tsunami,

Every steps have to be examined.

Moving in the prevailing loop,

Seemingly an endless troop,

Already decimated my suave self,

Happiest with only shelter, warmth & bread.

Reopened my shabby goals,

Shuddered with horror.

Looked in the mirror after a long,

A reflection of soggy life, haggard

Look telegraphed - unrequited love,

Bleak & taxing work,

Ambiguity in moral views,

Odious character grew -

All added to my woes.

What comes, always goes.

Can't succumb to despair,

Of savouring life, I have my share.

Lack of sunlight, path's hazy

Still driving with a smile, am I crazy?
