i have dreamed and i remember
the hypnagogic and later
the colors and the feel
the shivers in my spine
peculiarly comforting still
i may not be an old fox
but i have dreamed quite a lot
and when i reckon, it isn't that clear
like fog on glass, palimpsest, half-lost thought

i have dreamed:
red, disgust, unfulfilled desires
trippy anemoia
sweating fire
rainbowed pillow 
soaked in colorful tears
a reverie of wonderful world
the warmer the merrier
"phantasm" they call it
"lullaby" i hear

i have dreamed:
things that gave me clarity
and some that made me phobic
that whispered denied truth
and some were cathartic
screamed what i mustn't do
reminded who and what mattered
the ones i am afraid to lose
the worst that can happen
the best i can choose

i have dreamed a lot
and learned so few
but when i dreamed you
there was something new i knew 
i may deny but it's true
i wish it was ephemeral thus
but it stayed long after i withdrew
...the thought of us
