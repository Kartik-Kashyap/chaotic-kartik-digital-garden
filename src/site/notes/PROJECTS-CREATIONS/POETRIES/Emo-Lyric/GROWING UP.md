Reminiscing the past,

perplexed emotions triggered.

Memories died unlamented in vast,

some cherished, other flickered.

With people, stayed,

filled life's chapters, had fun, shined

‚Äîthen lost them in envisaged ways.

Hope you all doing fine,

we may never cross again.

Heart's aching, soul's crying,

nature's sublimity is uncertain.

Sole existence itself is futile,

only "changes" makes it worthwhile.

"Forever"‚Äîa loop of lies,

it's true, as time flies.
