how lucky am i?

yes.  
i never thought i’d love someone this much.  
but quietly,  
somewhere beneath my practiced stoicism,  
i always wanted to.

no matter how much i rolled my eyes at love stories,  
no matter how i scoffed at kisses in the rain,  
no matter how i pretended  
that romance and sex were for imbeciles

the truth?  
i adored love.  
i ached for it.  
i loved love.

i wanted someone  
whose arms felt like a place i could run into  
freely, when the world became too heavy,
and i could put my head on her shoulder, and cry.

i wanted someone  
whose gaze made me feel beautiful
both in mirrors, and in meanings.

i wanted someone  
who didn’t make me measure love in equal halves  
but let me pour mine freely,  
without wondering if i’d be left empty.

i wanted someone  
i could almost trust blindly  
not out of naivety,  
but because she’d hold my vulnerabilities  
like soft secrets she’d never drop.

and…  
i found her.

a singular, exquisite piece  
in the entire spinning universe.

my childhood crush.  
my hero.  
my wildest wish  
from when wishes still felt magical.

and she loves me back.

tell me,  
how lucky am i?

and not just love,  
we are devoted.  
a quiet vow stitched into the fabric of our soul.
tere hawale.
my dreams, my flaws, my future,
my body, my heart, my soul,
my best, my worst, my average,
all yours.

and i trust you.  
not in the way people toss the word around
but the kind where i’ve handed over  
my most fragile selves,  
and never once had to wonder  
"does she deserve this much of me?" 
because you never made me doubt.  
you only made me believe deeper,
and deeper,
with each passing second.

and if i'm honest
i saw the hints you gave,  
and also the hints my heart gave.
the way your words lingered longer than necessary. 
the way i wanted to make you mine from the start.
the way i craved to talk to you like an addict.
but i kept pretending not to notice.  
not because i wasn't sure
but because i thought,  
why would someone like _you_ love someone like _me_?

and yet,  
you were the first to say it aloud.  
i love you.
so full.  
so certain.  
like the universe whispered it to you.

and the way you described me
beautiful.  
not “good enough”  
but pretty,
khoobsurat,
cutuu,
handsome,
cool.
i got all the adjectives
from you,
the prettiest one in my eyes.

you don’t know what that did to me.  
how it made me feel seen,  
held,  
real.  
i walk these college corridors  
with a quiet confidence now,
because how can i disappoint her?
why would anyone's gaze matter to me
more than hers?
somewhere,  
miles away,  
the love of my life is sitting
believing in me.  
rooting for me.
waiting for me.
cheering for me to rise,  
so we can build a life  
unburdened by society’s noise or money’s weight.

we're waiting for that day
not just to be together,  
but to be _free_ together.

and until then,  
we’ve promised
our bodies will wait  
so our hearts don’t have to hide.

because when it happens,  
it will be soft,  
safe,  
sacred.  
a celebration,  
not a secret.

and so sometimes,  
in the quietest hour of night,  
i just sit still and wonder
how lucky am i?

to be loved like this,  
by someone so rare,  
so resolute,  
who sees beauty in my unbecoming  
and still stays.

this love
it’s not loud,  
but it’s eternal.  
not fast,  
but certain.

we're writing a story.  
we're planting a future.  
each promise,  
each pause,  
each prayer  
a seed.

and one day,  
when the world makes space for us,  
we’ll bloom,  
wildly,  
completely,  
_together._

yes, we’re just twenty 
a little lost, a little loud,  
still sketching blueprints of our lives  
with trembling hands and stubborn hope.

but still,  
we directly speak of marriage 
like it’s muscle memory,  
like our souls already rehearsed the vows  
long before we met in this life.
no doubts.
no nuances.
nothing.
we will be each others for this lifetime,
period.

because we aren't afraid of the
work, pain, compromise,
the love like ours demands.
we aren't afraid of long road ahead 
her in her world, me in mine
because every detour still maps back to _us._  
she’s not just my dream,  
she’s the one i’ll come home to after chasing them.

and we both know
no matter how raw,  
how unfinished we may seem now,  
we’re each other’s final draft.

uff,
**how lucky am i?**
