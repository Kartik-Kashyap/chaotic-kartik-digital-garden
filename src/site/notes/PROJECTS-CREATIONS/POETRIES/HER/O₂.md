i need to
i really need to 
tell you something
not just a connotation
not just a name
not just a metaphor
something more
a truth that i return to when i am feeling low
a truth that makes me pinch myself every night
a truth that i can't believe is not a lie

my heart did beat,
but not like this.
i used to breathe,
but not like this.
not until you slipped your voice into my lungs,
not until your fingers rewrote the script
of every scar on my skin
and called them stars.

you found me
skinny boy with galaxies of acne,
a stranger to his own reflection,
a ball full of insecurities.
sly.
pessimistic.
bitter.
i mistook invisibility for peace.
but you?
you saw the war behind my reticence
and kissed it like a soldier’s return.
filled my monochromatic life with colors
that the partially color blind me couldn't see before.

you told me i’m pretty.
not in spite of my past,
but because of it.
and i believed you.
for the first time,
i believed someone who called me beautiful.
not just out of kindness.
but out of desire,
a burning desire inside her
romantic and sexual.

you made me feel
my body is not shame
but shelter.
like every inch of me
from gym-strained veins
to the warmth in my voice
was worth desiring.

you touched my hands
and touched my soul.
said you’d jump in my lap if a cockroach came
gawd, what would i give to be that insect?
just to be your excuse to touch me more.

i remember:
your messages didn’t just land in my phone.
they landed in the pit of my doubts
and insecurities
and self-hatred
and existential crisis
and suicidal tendencies—
and burned a bonfire there.
all of them reduced to ashes.

you made them kneel 
and beg for mercy.
you didn't let me forgive,
instead handed me a gun
guided me to shoot,
but my hands trembled.
self-destructive side of me 
couldn't let me be free.
but you took the charge,
and killed all of them
with a single bullet
named "twinkle".

you healed me.
and i didn’t even know i was bleeding
until you loved me clean.
i thought something damaged 
can never be repaired.
but you proved me wrong,
and i couldn't be more happy.
i yearned for someone to save me.
you did.
and now i know,
i didn't need to push you away,
and i didn't need to be fixed,
before i deserved you.

because you held every version of me
i wanted to kill
in your warm hands
giving them solace
that they were the prologue
to the current me
that you fell for.

i swear 
every compliment you gave
breathed me into existence.
every “cutu” 
every "pretty”
every "zaddy"
every "baby"
every “ufff” 
every "aww"
you typed
was CPR to my dead boyhood.

now when i see my scars,
i don’t see shame.
i see evidence.
that i made it.
to you.
that i’m loved.
and i can finally look up from ground.
and i can finally breathe.

and when you ask:
“why do you love me so much?”
"itta pyaar kyun"
this is why.
and why not?!
you are my angel.
my hero.
the one i looked upto.
the one i wake up for.
the one i want to be better for.
the one i want to earn,
from those who claims you as theirs,
and are better than me.
(spoiler: soon... they won't be!)

you were the spark 
long before i knew what fire was.
you were my muse in the school days,
when i didn’t even know what to call admiration,
just that i wanted to stand on a stage 
the way you did
loud, brave, flowy, electric.
you were the reason i found the mic, 
the crowd, the voice inside me.
the butterfly effect you induced,
i can never ever repay that
in this lifetime.

and yet i never said a word to you.
you were a constellation i could only point at,
never touch.

until life looped us back.

and this time, i got to talk to you.
and then write for you.
and then make you laugh.
and then gift you.
and then admire you.
and then fight.
and then stay.

so when you say
“mai hi kyun?”
it’s not just the you now,
with your universe of beauty 
and intelligence 
and kindness.
it’s also the you then,
my unreachable star.
my childhood admiration 
that time forgot to fade,
gladly so.

you are the person 
who unknowingly shaped my passions.
and knowingly stayed.
you made me unlearn indifference.
you made me believe in slow-burning magic,
love,
destiny,
heaven.

i want to be colonized by you.
don't spare a single piece of my land.
take over my body, brain, heart, chemicals.
everything.

i want to trust you blindly
and devote myself to you entirely.
no questions
no rational counters
no doubts—
because no one else
would ever call me poetry
while i am still in drafts
and no one,
not a single soul,
ever became my O₂
the way you did,
being there in the air,
in the breath,
diffusing into every alveolus of my being,
(now i ain't a waste of oxygen anymore
as my oxygen is you, not the one they use),
and you stayed
because you knew 
anoxia can be fatal,
and you wouldn't let me die
because you love me to death,
so you kept me alive 
before i even knew 
i was 
suffocating—
so allow me.
please.
will you?
