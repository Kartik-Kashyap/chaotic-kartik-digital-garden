you’re smol
barely five feet of wonder
yet you are my sun
the star at the center 
of my solar system
i love you
in every possible way a heart can bloom.
there’s no condition, no clause,
just you
the prettiest truth i’ve ever known.

you call yourself ugly
seriously?
that's blasphemy.
your beauty?
ethereal exquisite
angel-drifted down into a messy world,
and still outshining it all.
your smile could light the damn planet,
and your existence alone?
meticulous, fine work of art. 
a masterpiece signed by the universe.

boyfriend effect?
i like them pictures raw
no need of filter as nothing to gnaw
and you 
are majestic
even in sweat pants
drool on your chin, sleepy lids,
hair a frizzed-out crown,
angles so weird, may only i get to see.
you menstruating, agitated, smelly?
no worries
your every scent is sweet and mine.
pheromones? perfume.
sweaty? that’s just the heat of a goddess.
and if only i could be the reason of that heat,
i would be validated for life and beyond

you’re still the prettiest
in every mood, every shade, every menstrual phase.
every adjective of beauty ever whispered
was just a failed attempt at describing you.

and oh lord
your neck hiding behind
those strands that fall, the bangs in disobedience
the tiny forehead i ache to kiss,
your eyes, fluid galaxies,
i could drown into and beg for more.
if my face ever reflects there, i’d call that divine.
cheeks i tug, nose i trace
until i slide on its curve
to lips i’d die to lock mine with,
and stop time. indefinitely.
whisper my name with your tongue when i am in your arms,
and i’ll float above every cloud i’ve ever known.
you push out the lips and pout 
when angry, or that deep-thought frown, 
or those juggling tantrums,
or tryna act cute
i’m drunk on every detail.
intoxicated af.

you ask why i ask for more?
those weird videos, and silly lore?
because in my gaze,
even the moon would beg for your flaws.
but there are none.
none that i can find,
none that would matter.
not when the very act of being you
is perfection breathing.
a poetry.
not anatomy.

you’re my angel,
my world,
my sweet, slippery slope of desire and devotion.
how lucky am i
to witness you exist?

and the reason i love it all?
is simple.
because it’s you.
and that’s enough.
that’s everything.

i’ve told you before,
i'll tell you some more,
tattooing it into the stars for all,
the one who's ugly is me,
and you’re the most beautiful thing,
i could ever ask for.
