i have dreamed and i remember
the hypnagogic and later
the colors and the feel
the shivers in my spine
peculiarly comforting still
i may not be an old fox
but i have dreamed quite a lot
and when i reckon, it isn't that clear
like fog on glass, palimpsest, half-lost thought

i have dreamed:
red, disgust, unfulfilled desires
trippy anemoia
sweating fire
rainbowed pillow 
soaked in colorful tears
a reverie of wonderful world
the warmer the merrier
"phantasm" they call it
"lullaby" i hear

i have dreamed:
things that gave me clarity
and some that made me phobic
that whispered denied truth
and some were cathartic
screamed what i mustn't do
reminded who and what mattered
the ones i am afraid to lose
the worst that can happen
the best i can choose

i have dreamed a lot
and learned so few
but when i dreamed you
there was something new i knew 
i may deny but it's true
i wish it was ephemeral thus
but it stayed long after i withdrew
...the thought of us

### interpretation 

>> I can't help but be influenced by the title of the piece. To me, it feels like longing - for something that was, or that cannot be, or perhaps simply for peace with what is. There are some feelings that hurt to hold ([[PROJECTS-CREATIONS/POETRIES/Narrative/Like Any Other Day/1. Switching Town\|1. Switching Town]]) - not because they are painful, but simply because they are too large. This piece feels to me like the kind of love that makes you want to cry.

>> I'm watching opportunities pass me by ([[PROJECTS-CREATIONS/POETRIES/Narrative/Like Any Other Day/4. For Granted\|4. For Granted]]), sort of like I'm watching other people live the life I wished I lived ([[PROJECTS-CREATIONS/POETRIES/Emo-Lyric/GROWING UP\|GROWING UP]]).

>> It’s like I’m frozen on a train station ([[PROJECTS-CREATIONS/POETRIES/Narrative/Like Any Other Day/3. Sunshine In Winter\|3. Sunshine In Winter]]) and I just see everyone around me going ([[PROJECTS-CREATIONS/POETRIES/Narrative/Like Any Other Day/2. Ticket Gate\|2. Ticket Gate]]) and I can’t.
