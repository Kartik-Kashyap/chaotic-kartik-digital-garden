Long-distance,
A lot changed.
Delegating delegating,
He proposed.
Highfalutin excitement,
Negotiations, permissions,
Doubt.
But optimist,
Planning fallacy.
He came,
He came to me.
Carving it's path with serendipity 
And unlamented sacrifices. 
Initial honeymoon phase,
Along fear of change,
Making house volatile.
Novelty of guest soon worn off.
Normalised, familiarised.
Repetition of patterns.
Crank, hatred - gratitude subside. 
Unwitting cold, rude, neglect?
Rubuked for trivial,
Emaciated him of love, care.
Defamiliarisation, empathic -
Of I was deficit.
When confronted -
Unabashed.
Levity.
Delusion of immortality.
Time optimist,
No, he can't be sick.. ?
He went back.
He gone.
No time track,
For so long.
Staggered, trembling goodbye.
Expressing gratitude, I shy.
Wistful reminiscence.
Absence -
Apathetic heart going fonder.
Regret of irreparable in hindsight. 
Plans that either come to naught, 
Or half a page of scribbled foresaken lines -
Planning fallacy's result.
Should I be effusive to his mere presence alone?
While I sat idle, in my crib.
Next phase, different place, not house but home -
Seeking, seeking... builder building.
Backstabbed... demolished it's construction.
One more time?
One more chance?
Chuckle -
Vicious cycle.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Devoid, though doesn't deserve them,
None.
Fatigue, 
Running a hedonic treadmill.
Comfortably emotionally numb, 
Paranoid, nihilist,
Chronic stress, pessimist,
Fight or flight.
Penchant of pain.
Welcome apathy, again.
Blaming all around,
I lie, strident.
Making all palatable -
High on copium.
He Pink,
I Floyd furred.
He meek,
I squandered. / avoid / void / waylaid

He destroys.
He waits for none.
