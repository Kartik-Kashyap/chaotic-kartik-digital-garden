In this town, left with just a little bit of twilight,
we wave timidly saying “see you later”, to segue into a gloomy night.
My eyes, brimmed with tears, follow as you pass beyond the ticket gate.
It might be the end as things don’t always go as we plan; there's fate.

Guided by the flickering street light, I dodged puddles as I return alone.
It has snatched one more salient thing of mine away - life's dreadfully uncertain.
I've been inundated with the cacophony of thoughts crossing the mind I no more own.
An air of pensive sadness gathered around me as I head home to lead the dreary life, once again.
