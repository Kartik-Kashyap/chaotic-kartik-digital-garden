Our feelings written out across many pages,
But somehow can’t seem to fill this sole blank line.
Struggled some more, then marked the place with a flower bookmark, 
to tumble along with you on our respective bicycles, hoping to get enlightened without delay.

The dots I'm gallantly try'na connect, reaches no-productive-where, since ages.
You though seem apathetic as you're soon switching towns but it's fine.
This same blue sky is, for me, excruciating to drive under as now it disguises itself as gloomy & dark.
You looked at me with your weepy eyes and that’s when you unconsciously thrusted a bundle of sunlight my way.
