Lot of uncertainty going on.

Lot of trepidation & fears.

Lot of non-substantial stress grown.

Lot of futile blood, sweat & tears.

Lot of unavoidable changes.

Lot of unethical money exchanges.

Lot of stupid people doing stupid things.

No way to enumerate all what's happening.

It seems every day things just get more ridiculous.

The existence on our little planetory rock is hilarious.

Though it's the same since a long,

we just now have access to more of what's going on.

So it's all stupid,

it's always been stupid,

it's always probably gonna be stupid!

Better take some time out to look around,

scrutinize the world, and go 'Wow!'

like 'this place is pretty cool'

& 'this life thing is pretty cool'.

Hence, in spite of all the stupidness,

I felicitate you for enduring till date.

Keep appreciating it for what it is & get by.

And, of course, live this stupid life!
