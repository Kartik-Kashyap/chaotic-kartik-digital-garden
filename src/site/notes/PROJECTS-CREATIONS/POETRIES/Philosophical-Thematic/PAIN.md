My best friend?
It's pain.
I embrace it's fear,
No one else that dear.
I am a loyal citizen in his rule.
It's my pertual fuel,
Like a peculiar gasoline,
Making me run till the end.
Acts like colour in this tedious journey,
Though a bit dark but emanating bliss.
I learned to befriend with sorrow & derision,
When I had nothing and no one
But pain,
my best friend.
