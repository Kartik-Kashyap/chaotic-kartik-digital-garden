Overcoming the night,
escaping the darkness,
I'm going out to face it.

A shiny morning sight,
with little rain & my readiness,
derived from regrets I holded.

Making a dark & delusioned room,
I closed my eyes.
To open the curtain for illuminating the room,
my shaking hands tries.

My happiness became emaciated,
as it thrived on schadenfreude,
I'll stop running away now, my feets are red.
Of facing reality, no more afraid.

No more averting eyes from inexactness,
the sea of wounds & destructive traits.
Free from ugliness and unworthiness,
New version of "me" awaits.

If you fear muddy footstep,
If you flinch or you cast your eyes down to toe,
in a supreme moment,
you might miss the rainbow.
