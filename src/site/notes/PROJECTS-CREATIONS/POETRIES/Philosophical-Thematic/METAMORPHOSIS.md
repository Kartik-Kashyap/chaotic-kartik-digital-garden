Did devoted service, never lifted the head,

Though the cause itself has been completed, moved on & dead.

Time to transform, failed to realize.

Fluidity in life, all I crave.

Should mosh with even excruciating phase of life,

& not shun or despise.

Hence broke adamant thoughts & ready to renew all these,

But the pain of metamorphosis

Filled me with dread, fear & trepidation of change.

But what can exist without it?

What's closer to nature's heart & veins?

Eat food without transforming it?

Can you warm your frigid hand and leave the firewood as it was?

Can any vital process take place without something being changed?

Snakes understand this thoroughly because

'principle of transformation' built into their biology itself.

Can't you see? It's just the same with you - and just as vital to nature.

Thus now looked inside this wimpy being,

And gave up most valuables.

Very often, when trying too hard, it's time to let off things.

Make the ship lighter by throwing gold in water.

Only the self helds back while commencing it's new chapter,

though what self thinks is most salient.

Devotee can find new home of emotions,

Even realise their true nature or different varient,

When separated are cause and the devotion.

Death - reminder of 'the time has come',

the first and last truth of life,

All started must end,

New generation gonna establish -

Don't let it gnaw you, just walk ahead

Carrying poised, flexible yet devotional intentions.
