## STORY

They met in the dim glow of a university library, amidst books that spoke of revolutionaries and rebellions. This place was their escape from the frigid, braindead world outside—a place to build a utopia in their minds.

He was from a lower caste; she, from an upper-caste conservative politically involved background. He knew the weight of a surname that shut doors before he could even knock. She knew the suffocation of the glass ceiling, the burden of her family's dignity placed on her vagina—privilege wrapped in shackles. Two souls who had spent their lives navigating the labyrinth of invisible walls of oppression found a shared reality between them—enough to spark love.

Late nights were spent unveiling philosophy, dissecting history, consuming and analyzing art from all over the world, arguing over politics, world order, and dreaming of a world where love wasn’t this political—where it wasn’t a nightmare so terrifying that hatred seemed like the easier option. Their minds danced before their bodies ever did. But when they kissed for the first time, it wasn’t gentle—it was a storm, a protest, a promise. Yet as their lips parted, reality snapped back into place.

They knew the cost of their love.

If anyone found out, their bodies would be cold by sunrise.

So they stepped back, picking pragmatism over passion. Avoided each other. Let silence stretch between them, pretending nothing ever happened. They had never made those "forever" promises anyway—so it mustn't hurt.

Or at least, that’s what they told themselves.

But love is not a quiet submissive thing. It does not shrink; it does not dissolve. It lingers, gnaws, demands to be lived.

And when they met again, after weeks of aching, there was no hesitation, no doubt.

"Even if we must die for it, we will love."

Her family had already begun their search for a "suitable" groom. She refused. She would not let tradition dictate her life. 

He, in turn, worked tirelessly, graduating with honors, landing a respectable job. She, too, carved her own path, earning a position that gave her the independence she was never meant to have. 

They built a future in secret, brick by stolen brick, hoping to outrun the past.

But love stories like theirs do not go unnoticed. Something this dazzling can't be packed in the dark for long. 

One night, in a hotel room meant to be a sanctuary, they were found. The receptionist, a man who knew her father well, made the call. The trap was set before they could escape. When the first fist banged against the door, they knew there was no way out.

So they fought. They ran.

They hijacked a vehicle, wind roaring in their ears as they sped into the night, her family's men close behind, guns raised, fingers on triggers. But they didn't care. 

They laughed—loud, unafraid, reckless. Nervous laughter, some will say, but they were past these petty connotations. They drove fast, careless, their love defying the bullets chasing them.

And in their minds, through the static of fear and adrenaline, a song blared—a shared anthem of freedom, a fuel for the non-conformist lovers—from their favorite Hollywood film, The Perks of Being a Wallflower.

David Bowie’s *Heroes*.

*"I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be Heroes, just for one day.
We can be us, just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever
Then we could be Heroes, just for one day
We're nothing, and nothing will help us 
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day"*

The headlights cut through the darkness, but the road ahead was an abyss. A shot rang out. Tires screeched. The world flipped.

The car crashed. Flames swallowed their bodies before the world could. 

They were gone.

But their love did not die, as they say, "Where there is love there is life."

The news spread like wildfire. Their names became a battle cry. Protests erupted. The youth raged. Their story was inked into banners, chanted in streets, whispered in defiance. Their love became legend, proof that even in death, some flames never go out.

They did not get to live. But they became immortal. Expanding their second death to aeons. Because love, when fearless, is never forgotten.
