I went down on her and slowly pulled her shorts form her hips.
She wasn't wearing undies. Guess she knew what was coming.

Her thighs parted like petals.
Not in surrender.
But in command. 

I knew, theoretically, vulva came in all shapes and sizes.
But I never knew it could be this exquisite.
It was engorged.
And wet.
For me.

And I knelt there.
Not as an insecure boy trying to impress.
But as her man, ready to worship.
I kissed her inner thigh again.  
Soft.  
Then closer.  
Then again.

I teased the area around the clit before diving straight in.
The smell down there was so erotic I wanted to submerge myself there but I took things slow.

She whimpered, her fingers curling in the sheet.  
Nothing was dramatic or loud or how it's showed in porn.  
It was raw.
And sensual.
I was rock hard. The hardest I had ever been. My tight shorts didn't help it. I had to adjust it with my hands, and direct it upwards.

I looked up at her.  
Her expressions were otherworldly. 
Her chest rising and falling.
Her parted lips. 
Pleading eyes. 
Shy, and feral all at once.

And then my lips finally met her clit.  
Again, not to “perform.”
Not to fuel my *ego*.
But to _listen_.  
To _respond_.  
To _learn the language of her gasps_.
To *explore the godly frame in which the sweetest soul resides in*.

I savored its raw taste.
Every bit of it.
Tongue flat, slow swirl.  
Then a gentle suck, just enough to make her body jolt. Guess the warmth of my tongue caught her.
So I switched to blowing, which I read creates a cooling sensation that makes the area even more sensitive and excitable. Guess reading isn't that bad.
And then I gently nibbled it.
Like it was a miniature dick. 

Her thighs tried to close around my head.  
I let them.  
Held them.  
She was trembling.

And when I slid two fingers in, curling them ever so slightly, she arched violently. Hips pressing up into me. Her nails scratched the bedsheet.

I could feel it rising.  
The shudders. The gasps.  
That one moment where she was everything and nothing.

Her hand grabbed my wrist, eyes wide, unsure whether to ask me to stop or never stop again.
I grabbed her pretty breast again.
And I locked eyes with her.  
And didn’t stop.  
And she came.
Beautifully.  
Body curling, voice cracking, hips pulsing.

And in that moment,  
I came too.  
No touch. No friction. No stroke.  
Just her pleasure crashing into mine.
Our genitals knew telepathy. 
What more a mere human like me could ask for.

My shorts got messy from the release. So I removed them. Even I didn't have my undies on me. 
So now we both were completely naked. For the first time, after our bodies had developed sexually. Completely vulnerable. It was sacred. It was the embodiment of our immense trust. We preserved this feeling for each other. And it'll be exclusive to each other, for eternity.

Later when the aftershocks faded, and she lay in my arms, she whispered, _“That was... what was that? Heaven? That was just from... your mouth?”_

I smiled against her ear.  

I rolled her gently onto me, her body featherlight.  
5 feet of poetry.  
My ran my callus-filled palms over her waist, her back, her thighs, her ass.

She sat up slowly, straddling me.  
Her breasts kissed my chest.  
The scent of her skin, and her sweat, mixed with genital juices, was ethereal. 
Made me go wild.

Her hips rocked slowly.  
I felt her wetness against me.  
God, the pressure. The promise.

We did 69 instinctively.  
Our bodies moved into it like we had done this in every lifetime before.

I kissed her clit again, more greedily this time
And her mouth took me in, completely.
The heat of her mouth gave me pleasures I didn't know was humanely attainable.
I wasn't insecure about my little friend anymore.
She loved the boyfriend-size, the shape, the smell, the taste.
She savored it all, just like I did.

We moaned into each other’s bodies.
My breath hot on her folds.
Her breath muffled around my cock.  
Our love language became gasps, licks, vibrations, surrender.

Then I made my spine erect, and she slid on my lap. 
I picked her up easily and carefully spread her on the bed, her back facing me.
I then traced her spine with my tongue.
And hovered over her.
Elbows firm, planking.  
Never letting her feel my weight.  
Only my warmth.

“Comfortable, baby?” I asked.  
She smiled, eyes dreamy.  
“Always. With you.”

My body didn’t crave sex. 
It craved her. 
Fully. Unapologetically. Skin, soul, scent. 
Everything that's HER.
