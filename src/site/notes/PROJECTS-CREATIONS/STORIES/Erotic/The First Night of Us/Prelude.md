We returned to the hotel room.
Tired from all the travel and novelty and "today I learned".
Today I came to visit her for the first time in Delhi. This was the only possibility of "us" and I couldn't miss it.
And we both nerds didn't waste a single second to go to the nerdiest places there.
We held each other's hands. Gave a peck here and there when we felt we had some privacy in overcrowded India.
I surely had a difficult time deciding what to focus on: Her or Delhi.

We played dead on the bed for a minute.
Silent.
But our hearts were loquacious.
She sensed it too. She advised we should take a shower. I thought the keyword was "we". I was down for it. But she added, "I'm going first". Mini heartbreak but ok.

I opened my bag. I had "it" with me. I thanked my proactive self.

I, out of instinct, got shirtless, to flex my muscles, when I saw there's mirror sitting in front of the bed.

She came out of the shower few minutes later, with only towel wrapped around her body. She paused there seeing me make weird poses and faces. She chuckled. I noticed her and felt embarrassed. But I could see something in her eyes scanning me. A desire. I hope she could see mine. I could already feel something in my chest. She was looking majestic.

I went in. Brushing each part of my body with perfumed toiletries, including my teeth. I saw myself in the mirror before I came out. I asked myself, "Is this the night that I have been dreaming of since so long?"

I came out.
Her warmth hit me first.  
Not her skin, not her touch.  
Just the feeling of her. 
Her presence.
And that we will be in the same room.
On the same bed.
For the whole night.
The night of us.

The scent of her in the room was a pheromonal warning that read: _you’re never walking out of this room the same again_.

She was sitting on the edge of the bed, looking herself in the mirror, wearing a pink short, and MY t-shirt that for her was oversized, swallowing her petite frame like it had sworn loyalty to her softness. I get it, anyone including herself would get lost in her beauty. My breath caught in my throat when she looked up to me.

I smiled and asked her why my t-shirt. She said, "I was dying to feel you wrapped around me"

I didn't wait. I went to her and wrapped her around me. Close. And tight. We stayed like that for a couple of minutes. Then I kissed her forehead, and freed her from my arms. She got sweaty, and so did I. We both were dying to have each other.

But unsure, I put a t-shirt and a short on me.
She was confused.
"Tu so hi ja," she said jokingly and tossed on the side of bed. 
But the smirk said, _you dare sleep right now, I’ll actually maarungi teko._

We walked a lot today. Seeing her delicate body, I asked her if her leg was aching.
She said yes. A little.
I went to her. I grabbed her feet. Almost like I wanted to worship it.
I started massaging it gently. She said wow, keep doing. I was happy being able to relief her pain. 

I went up her legs. I massaged her calves. I massaged her thighs. It made a shiver pass down her spine. She then decided to lay on her stomach. She signaled me to go upwards. My hands felt restless. But I resisted. I massaged her waist.

And when I thought I did my work well and I would be praised, she side eyed me and sat up in a jiffy.  She looked irritated and starved.
"Looks like even here I will need to make the first move, right?!"
Wrong.
I will do that.
I got my pass.
I was not gonna step back now.
So I stepped closer, the room dim and slow.  
She didn’t move.  
She just blinked once.  
A slow, curious blink.  
Like she was reading me.
Unwrapping me with her gaze.

She pulled my t-shirt's sleeve over her palm, and said quietly, “You smell like... something I want to remember forever.” Her voice was sultry, and wet.

I blushed hard, my knees sinking onto the bed beside her.  
"And you feel like... something I’d worship every day and still never know completely."

“Sachhi?” she asked, raising an eyebrow.  
"Hnji!" I replied, with as sweet voice as I could get out of my throat.
But alas, I could never imitate the sweetness of her voice.

I leaned in. Our noses touched.
We shared a smile.
And then we kissed. 
Slowly.  
Like a vow.
Deep.
Time stopped for us.
Our bodies were warmer than a heater.
Nothing existed then except us.
I got to know what being in the moment feels like.

My hand cradled her jaw as our lips moved like they already knew each other from our common dreams. Her slightly trembling body shifted closer to mine, her hands finding the nape of my neck.

I didn’t rush.
I savored every moment.
I moved to kissing her cheeks.
Rubbing her soft skin against my face felt so blissful.
As my ear came closer to her lips, she whispered my name in it.
"Kartik" never sounded this cute, lovely, and hot.
It made me want to melt on her tongue.
So I did.
We locked our lips again.
I made her lie down slowly so she doesn't hit her head on the hard edge of bed.
I put her skull on the fluffy pillow.
I was on top of her. Planking. She wasn't feeling my bodyweight but she had to suffer the wrath of the weight of my love.

Then I let my kisses drift down to her neck.  
Soft, damp kisses. The kind that stay.
Neck was her weak spot, I knew.

She signaled me to open my t-shirt. I did, with her help. Then I removed my lucky t-shirt from her, that got a chance to be wrapped around this goddess underneath me. She wasn't wearing anything beneath it. We both were upper body naked. I avoided eye contact with her breast because my heart couldn't handle it so I kept performing my kissing ritual as she caressed my back.

Her breath hitched when I whispered something stupid, just to see her laugh in the middle of it. And she did, half-laugh, half-moan, like her body didn’t know which reaction to choose.

We then lay back, her one leg curled around mine, our bodies tangled like they were sketching their own position.

I kissed her collarbone like it was sacred.  
Let my fingers explore her ribcage, featherlight, making her shiver.  
And then I slowly went down and placed a kiss on her soft breast.
She breathed heavily. I stopped to see if she's comfortable. Her facial expression confirmed, she was.

So I cupped her. 
Gently.
Reverently.
Her nipples got erect with just my touch.
Before I even kissed them.

And when I finally did, just a light suck, a touch of the tongue, and a twist, her back curved so beautifully, so vulnerably, it led to my downfall.

I paused.
I snapped out.
My insecurities took over.
I thought do I even deserve her.
I am so ugly, why a girl so pretty letting me touch her like this.

She sensed my demons were overpowering me, right before I lost to them.
Her cozy soft tiny hands held my cheek.
And brought me closer to her.
And she whispered, almost shyly,  
“Don’t stop. Please. It’s... me. You don’t have to hold back. I crave everything about you. Your touch. Your kiss. Your breath. Your body. Everything. I want you to feel the heat inside of me.”

I felt so loved.
Because I was allowed to love,
Her.

“You give me the power to ruin myself,” I whispered in her ear as she buried her face on my chest.
“But I’d rather heal you with it,” she whispered back as she counted my heart rate. It was fast. Really fast.
"Put your hands on me, Kartik."

I got the reference. And I was ready for it. 
I placed my hands on her breast. I kissed her again. This time, fast, ruthlessly, passionately like there was no next time.

I went down and kissed her belly. Her thighs. Her inner thighs.  
Slower. Deeper. Damp. Watching her breathe, sharp and staggered, yet so in rhythm with mine.

She held my head, buried her fingers in my hair,  
and I felt it. Her body trembling under my lips.  
And in that moment, her pleasure became mine.  
I didn’t need to come.  
I just needed to see her collapse in the aftermath of ecstasy, eyes fluttering shut, chest rising fast, a smile on her face that no one in the world had ever seen before.

A smile just for me.
Exclusively me.

She pulled me close after. Our foreheads touched.  
“What's next? I don’t want to sleep,” she whispered in her seducing voice.
I kissed her again.

“Then don’t. Just lie here. Let me breathe on your skin till you forget time exists.”

And we did.
